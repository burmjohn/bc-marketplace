# bc-marketplace

Claude Code plugin for searching and installing Boomi Marketplace recipes. Installs recipe bundles into a target account as reference samples that can inform how integrations are built.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add OfficialBoomi/boomi-companion
/plugin install bc-marketplace@boomi-companion
```

Requires `boomi-integration` plugin for recipe installs. The install script sources `boomi-common.sh` from bc-integration for authentication and activity logging. Catalog search works standalone. This plugin also depends on bc-integration's folder management, component pulling tools, and platform knowledge to complete its workflow.

## Versioning

`CHANGELOG.md` and the `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` are managed by CI on merge to main. Do not edit them directly.

To record a change, create a file in `changes/` named after the branch (if the branch contains a `/`, use only the part after the slash). Content is the changelog entry with `- ` prefix:

```
