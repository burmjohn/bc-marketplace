# boomi-marketplace Skill

Search and install Boomi Marketplace recipes as reference samples for AI-assisted integration development. The intended audience of this README.md document is humans seeking to understand the skill.

## What is this?

A distributable skill that provides AI coding agents with knowledge and tooling for working with the Boomi Marketplace catalog. It enables:

- Searching the public Boomi Marketplace for published recipes matching an app or use case
- Installing recipe bundles into a target Boomi account as reference samples
- Activity logging for all install attempts

Recipes are reference patterns, not production-ready components. Use them for structure and approach when building integrations.

## Prerequisites

- `curl` (universally available)
- `jq` (install via `brew install jq` on macOS or `apt install jq` on Linux)

### For installs only

- The `bc-integration` plugin must be installed and its skill loaded — the install script sources `boomi-common.sh` from bc-integration for authentication, credential validation, and activity logging.
- A configured `.env` file in your project root with Boomi platform API credentials (see the boomi-integration skill README for details).

## Installation

### Claude Code (via the bc-marketplace plugin)

Install through the Claude Code plugin system — the skill is included automatically:

1. Add the Boomi marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add OfficialBoomi/boomi-companion`
2. Install the plugin: `/plugin install bc-marketplace@boomi-companion`

Alternatively, navigate the `/plugin` menu interactively within Claude Code to add the marketplace and install.

### Manual configuration

Clone or copy this skill directory into the location your platform uses for agent skills. Consult your platform's documentation for the correct skill directory path.

## Usage

### Workflow

1. **Search** — Describe what you're building. The agent queries the Marketplace GraphQL API for matching recipes (no authentication required).
2. **Install** — The agent creates a `marketplace-imports` subfolder inside a project folder and runs the install script to deploy the recipe bundle there.
3. **Read** — The agent uses bc-integration's component pulling workflow to fetch the installed process XML and its dependencies locally for review.

### Example Workflow

```
You: "Find a marketplace recipe for Salesforce to NetSuite integration"

Agent: [Searches the Marketplace GraphQL API]
       [Presents matching recipes with descriptions]

You: "Install that one as a reference"

Agent: [Creates marketplace-imports folder]
       [Runs install script with the recipe's bundle ID]
       [Pulls installed components locally via bc-integration]
       [Reviews the process structure to inform the build]
```

## Tools Overview

The skill makes the following CLI tool available to the agent:

- `boomi-marketplace-install.sh` — Installs a marketplace recipe bundle into a target folder. Handles authentication via bc-integration's shared infrastructure, validates credentials before calling the API, and logs all activity.

```
BOOMI_COMMON_SH=<path/to/boomi-common.sh> bash scripts/boomi-marketplace-install.sh --bundle-id <artifactSourceId> --folder-id <numeric_folder_id>
```

Optional: `--target-account-id <ID>` overrides the install target (defaults to `BOOMI_ACCOUNT_ID` from `.env`).

## Documentation Structure

The skill includes the following reference documentation:

- [GraphQL API](references/graphql-api.md) — Public catalog search queries and response format
- [Bundle API](references/bundle-api.md) — Authenticated recipe installation via the Bundle Service API

## Support and Issues

This skill is designed originally for Claude Code, but Agent Skills are an open standard accessible to other models and platforms.

If you encounter issues:

1. This course provides an excellent intro to Claude Code: https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-code-in-action
2. We would love your feedback and input via developer-offerings@boomi.com
3. Your AI agent can often help troubleshoot and explain issues
